The Precise Ledger Pro is a Dynamic Event-Streamed Auditable Loan Ledger

## What is it?
It is a loan ledger system leveraging event-streaming to handle transactions, reversals, and back-dated entries dynamically.
The Dynamic Event-Streamed Auditable Ledger solves the problem of accurately managing and auditing ledgers with complex transactions, including back-dated entries and reversals, ensuring real-time integrity and historical accuracy.

## How is it different from existing solutions? 
Incorporating transaction reversals and past-dated transactions requires careful calculation of the impact of the change on the ledger including the change in the interest accruals. Although textbooks and subject matter experts talk about adding adjustments, thereâ€™s no systematic algorithm provided to compute the adjustment entries.

## How is it better?
In Precise Ledger Pro, the algorithms to calculate adjustment entries ensure accurate, real-time loan balances and impact calculations, enhancing auditability and financial integrity.
The system is adaptable to new transaction types and rules, scalable with evolving event-streaming technologies and ledger needs. Event-streaming systems are known to be massively scalable by leveraging distributed systems.
